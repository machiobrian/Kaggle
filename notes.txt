Supervised learning -> Classification and Regression : threr is sampled outcome

Classification -> dicerete results -> 1/0
Regression -> results are continous (spread over a range due to various varying factors) 
in nature

This is an example of a binary classification problem in supervised learning 
as we are classifying the outcome of the passengers as either one of two classes,
 survived or did not survive the Titanic.

 investigate how different passenger features like their 
 age, 
 gender, 
 ticket class 
 etc impact their survival outcome.

 The evaluation metric of this competition is the percentage of 
 passengers in the test set that are correctly predicted by our classifier


1. EDA - Exploratory Data Analysis -> The process of visualizing and analysing data to 
 extract insight:
Pandas library is used

2. Data Pre-Processing : 

Missing values -> Drop or Fill
Data transormation
Feature Engineering : Domain expertise, industry knowledge and experience is required
-> creating new feetures from existing ones to better understand the underlying problem
Label encoding : having it as 1/0s

3. Model Training: scikit learn
